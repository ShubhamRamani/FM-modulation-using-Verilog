# FM-modulation-using-Verilog
FM modulation using NCO IP in Verilog


📌 Overview
A Verilog-based Narrowband Frequency Modulation (NBFM) system implemented using Numerically Controlled Oscillators (NCOs) and simulated in ModelSim. The design generates carrier and message signals digitally, processes them through multiplier-based synthesis, and outputs a narrowband FM waveform.

🔹 Features
📡 FM Modulation in Verilog — Digital implementation for FPGA-based systems.
⏳ High Angular Precision — Adjustable NCO bit-widths for fine control.
📊 Efficient Hardware Design — Multiplier-based synthesis instead of large lookup tables.
🔄 Configurable Parameters — Carrier & message frequencies are fully adjustable.
🖥 RTL + Simulation Verified — ModelSim simulation and RTL Viewer validation.
